									<h3>Bryan Ang Wei Ze, Chief Executive Officer</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Since young, Bryan has always been intrigued in Websites and how to create them. At the age of 10, he even took it to the extent to research and learn about simple coding which lead him into winning several competitions in primary school. While students were actively studying in school, Bryan would think of creative ways to tinker and craft a website. He was too young to understand the HTML coding but he drew many and many website templates in paper and kept it in a file. In secondary school, he learnt simple java and html and he can craft very simple websites but he realised that it was not enough to reach the level of creating real and responsive website. Bryan consulted his brother which job is a website creator and Bryan will find each and every opportunity to take part in competition. He scored many medals in it, sometimes he may win and if other times he lost, he kept his grit and continue studying hard. His burning fire of passion kept on fighting through secondary school.</p>
