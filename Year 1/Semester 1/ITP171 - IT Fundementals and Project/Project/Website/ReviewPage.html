							I personally feel that your app is so broad that it almost have aspects of trouble singapore faced. However, the UI of your app can be improved as some buttons upon clicking, crashed the app. However, that's just a minor problem as i faced it very seldom. The erratic design of your app looks quite interesting to me however turned me off as your app design differs majorly from one screen to another
							for example, suddenly white font in a page to black font in another, pictures dont quite make sense. Hence, i'm unimpressed with your UI and background design but very impressed in the functions of your app. Kudos, keep it up.

							The app itself is beast! It incoperates almost every problem of bad user experience of public transport. I love the layout of the app, the layout is very user friendly and the rewards section is very generous! Able to garner many support from many different company is incredible. However, there are a few bugs in the app itself. For example, some claiming of rewards function is not very clear of what to do when you clicked that function. For example, the first reward, the grab discount, it displays ready to claim reward but when i clicked it, it brought me to the 'top up' page instead. Hence if they could be changed, the app would be perfect

							Being an exercise consultant of our app and CEO of The Brotherhood Inc, i feel that this app has the potential to be game changing. As said by other beta-testers, I love how this app incoperates almost every bad user experience solution. It is like an elixer to a deadly poison. Although the app idea is very efficient and nice, I feel that the app interface and color coordination can be improved.Also there are multiple bugs in the app, one of which is the rewards page grab discount which one of the reviewees already emphasized. However i realised another one. It is the Alternate route. It is located at the very top corner of the page which makes it very hard to be recognised. Since it is a very important and emphasized function in your application, hence i feel that it must be more recognisable
							hence user can recognise it easily and it will be made use of. Innovative idea, artstyle and layout of app can be improved. Keep it up!

						I love the usability of the app. It gives consumers an outreach by feeding them information through their phone, also allowing them to purchase funds to their EZ-link cards through their phone. However, as people mentioned, the UI and layout can be better. Better font, and background selection. The current app now looks like very messy and disorganised. In a nutshell, i recommend this app to each and every singaporean as it can assist your experience of taking public transport.

						When we were given a change to beta test this revolutionary app, we were very excited due to it sheer amount of support from SMRT LTA and many different organisations. We felt after beta testing that the app is perfectly potrayed. Very well designed and user friendly app. Singaporeans on our forum now is talking about this app. Its intensive focus on perfecting user experiences really reflects on the sheer amount of hardwork and time that is being consumed the create this app. We therefore, are all very proud of this app. You have the chance to change everything. Keep up the good work!
