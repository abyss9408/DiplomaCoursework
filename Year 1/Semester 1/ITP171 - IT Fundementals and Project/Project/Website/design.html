								<h3 class="intro">Introduction</h3>
								<p>Design thinking is a mindset and having an intentional process in order to get to new, relevant solutions that create positive impact. It consists five components: Define the challenge, Hunan Centred Research, Creative Ideation, Iterative Prototype and Evaluate. Below is descriptions of what we did in each component:</p>
								<h3 class="intro">Define the challenge</h3>
								<p>In the beginning, we have chosen to tackle the issues that all commuters face when taking public transport. We as a team listed all the things we know and don't know about the issues that commuters face. This help us to understand the challenge better and we plan how we are going to tackle the challenge as a team. </p>
								<h3 class="intro">Human Centred Research</h3>
								<p>After defining the challenge, we have to start to research on how are we going to tackle the issues. We as a team decided to go out and interview commuters so that we can know what are the issues people face when taking public transport. We started creating a survey that we can asked the commuters and we went to interview commuters. When we asked what are the issues they face, they mentioned about train breakdown and overcrowding. And when we asked the commuters to rate the transport system on a scale from 1(very bad) to 10(very good), to our surprise, most of the commuters gave a high score as they think that our transport system is fast and convenient. We gathered all the results and started to evaluate.</p>
								<h3 class="intro">Creative ideation</h3>
								<p>After evaluating the data we have collected in Human Centered Research, we decide not to tackle the issues the commuters faced as breakdown and overcrowding issues are issues that are beyond us. Hence, instead of tackling the issues the commuters faced, we decided to enhance the commuter's experience when taking public transport. After that, we started brainstorming ideas and ways that we can do to help enhanced the commuter's experience. We managed to come out with 30 ideas and 3 solutions. We carefully analysed all the idea and solution. We group some of the great idea into a solution. Lastly, we pick the most ideal solution based on desirability, feasibility, viability and novelty.</p>
								<h3 class="intro">Iterative Prototype</h3>
								<p>After creative ideation, we need to implement the most ideal solution in an application. This is when we started to use prototyping tools,marvelapp to create a prototype of our app before we started working on the actual one. After inserting our most ideal solution, we decided to include our other solution into the application because we need our app to be the greatest transportation application out there so that we can eliminate the competition out there. We did that and we are very proud of our application. </p>
								<h3 class="intro">Evaluate</h3>
								<p>This is where we started developing our website to advertise our application.</p>
